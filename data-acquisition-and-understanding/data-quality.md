# Data Quality

For data quality, we care about 

* Accuracy: incorrect, inaccurate, transmission error, duplicates
* Completeness: not recorded, not available...
* Consistency: outliers, inconsistent data...
* Interpretability: how easily the data can be understood

Data Cleaning: examining the data to correct for missing values, outliers and noise
